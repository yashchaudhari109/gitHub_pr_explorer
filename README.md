🔐 Token Handling Explained
- The application simulates a login flow to demonstrate secure token handling, as requested in the bonus requirements.
- Login Screen: On first launch, the user is presented with a dummy login screen.
- Token Generation: Pressing the "LOGIN" button generates a hardcoded fake token (e.g., "abc123...").
- Secure Storage: This fake token is securely stored on the device's local storage using the shared_preferences package.
- State Management: The AuthBloc manages the authentication state. On successful login, it emits an AuthAuthenticated state.
- Navigation Control: The go_router is configured to listen to the AuthBloc's state stream. If the state is AuthAuthenticated, it automatically redirects the user to the pull request list. If not, it shows the login screen.
- Token Display: On the pull request screen, the stored token is retrieved and displayed at the top to confirm that the login state is being correctly read and persisted across app sessions.

🌟 Bonus Features Implemented 
 - Simulated Token Storage: Implemented using shared_preferences.
 - Pull to Refresh: The PR list can be refreshed by swiping down.
 - Retry on Failure: A "Retry" button appears if the API call fails.
 - Responsive Layout: The UI is built with widgets that adapt to different screen sizes.
 - Dark Mode: The app is ready for a dark theme (foundation laid in app_theme.dart).
 - Shimmer Loading: A shimmer animation is shown while fetching data for a better user experience.
 - Dynamic Repository Changer: (Self-implemented bonus) An "Edit" button allows users to fetch PRs from any public repository.
 - Detailed Error Handling: Specific, user-friendly error messages for different failure scenarios (e.g., "Repository Not Found").
 - Detailed PR View with Clickable Links: Users can tap a PR to view its full body, with all links being automatically detected and launchable in a browser.

🐞 Known Issues or Limitations
- No Tests: Widget or unit tests have not been implemented for this assignment.
- Limited Tablet Optimization: While the layout is responsive, it is not specifically optimized with a multi-column layout for tablet devices.
- Fake Token: As per the assignment, the token is a simulation and does not provide access to private repositories.
